# Alert Analysis Summary

## Overview
Based on the analysis of 9 Azure Monitor Alert CSV files from `Portal-Alerts_all` and 7 Application Insights inventory files from `Portal-Monitor-Applications_all`, here are the key findings:

## Alert Dataset
Found in `client/public/data/Portal-Alerts_all/`:
- Azure-Monitor-Alerts.csv
- Azure-Monitor-Alerts (1).csv through (8).csv

Key characteristics:
1. Schema: Name, Severity, Affected resource, Target resource type, Alert condition, User response, Monitor service, Signal type, Fire time, Last modified time, Subscription, Target resource group, Suppression status
2. Common alert families:
   - "CRL Lab Integration - AccessionCode is Missing..."
   - "Abbott Lab Integration - Invalid Result File"
   - "Uniform Lab Result - Form association"
   - "Backup Failure"
   - Application Insights alerts
   - Platform/Log Alerts V2
   - Resource Health alerts

## Application Insights Inventory
Found in `client/public/data/Portal-Monitor-Applications_all/`:
- Azurecomponents.csv
- Azurecomponents (1).csv through (6).csv

Key characteristics:
1. Schema: NAME, RESOURCE GROUP, LOCATION, SUBSCRIPTION
2. Notable patterns:
   - Many dev/qa/prod instances (e.g., "dev-dps-app-insights", "qa-dps-app-insights", "prod-dps-app-insights")
   - Strong presence in East US region
   - Multiple environment subscriptions (e.g., "DISAWorks Platform Lower/Upper", "Infrastructure Sandbox")

## Initial Code Setup Status
1. TypeScript Configuration:
   - Fixed tsconfig.json (removed deprecated "ignoreDeprecations": "6.0")
   - Updated App.tsx theme provider props (replaced storageKey with switchable)
   - TypeScript now compiles cleanly (npx tsc --noEmit passes)
2. Development Server:
   - Running on port 3001 (3000 was in use)
   - Successfully started with npm run dev

## Next Steps

I can run any of these detailed analyses now:

1. Alert Analysis Deep Dive:
   - Top 10 alert families by frequency
   - Severity distribution
   - Resource type concentrations
   - Alert suppression rates
   - Duplicates/repeat alerts within time windows

2. Application Insights Coverage Analysis:
   - Environment distribution (dev/qa/prod instances)
   - Regional distribution
   - Subscription coverage
   - Resource group patterns

3. Code/Performance Analysis:
   - Review App Insights alert thresholds and rules
   - Identify opportunities for alert grouping
   - Suggest query optimizations

Would you like me to focus on any of these analyses specifically? I can:
1. Generate exact alert frequency tables (CSV + Markdown)
2. Map App Insights coverage gaps
3. Suggest specific alert tuning opportunities

Let me know which of these you'd like to explore first, and I'll generate the detailed analysis.
