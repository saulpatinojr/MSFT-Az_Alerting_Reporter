# Alert Configuration Analysis

## Current Alert Pattern Analysis

### Signal Type Distribution by Severity
- **Sev1 Alerts (Critical Operations)**
  - Log Search: 92% of Sev1 alerts
    - Lab Integration errors (CRL, Abbott, Quest)
    - Backup failures
    - Form association failures
  - Application Insights: 8% of Sev1 alerts
    - Integration endpoint failures
    - Data processing errors

- **Sev3 Alerts (Infrastructure)**
  - Platform Metrics: 95%
    - Service plan monitoring
    - API health checks
    - Resource utilization
  - Performance Monitoring: 5%
    - Database scaling operations

- **Sev4 Alerts**
  - Resource Health: 100%
    - Basic infrastructure health

### Resource Type Analysis
1. **microsoft.insights/components**
   - Primary use: Lab integration monitoring
   - Severity: Predominantly Sev1 (85%)
   - Signal types: Log search, Application Insights
   - Examples: CRL Lab Integration, Abbott Lab Integration

2. **microsoft.web/serverfarms**
   - Primary use: Service plan health
   - Severity: Exclusively Sev3
   - Signal types: Platform metrics
   - Examples: qa-dps-lab-alerts, dev-dps-lab-int-alerts

3. **microsoft.recoveryservices/vaults**
   - Primary use: Backup operations
   - Severity: Exclusively Sev1
   - Signal types: Log search
   - Examples: Backup Failure alerts

4. **microsoft.documentdb/databaseaccounts**
   - Primary use: Performance monitoring
   - Severity: Sev3
   - Signal types: Platform metrics
   - Examples: cosmosruscaledown

### Alert Pattern Insights

1. **Business Process Monitoring (Sev1)**
   - Focus on lab integration failures
   - Backup system failures
   - Data processing errors
   - All using log-based detection

2. **Infrastructure Health (Sev3/4)**
   - Service plan metrics
   - Database scaling
   - Resource utilization
   - Using platform metrics

### Recommendations

1. **Alert Aggregation Needed**
   - High frequency of repeated lab integration errors
   - Consider implementing smart groups for related alerts
   - Example: Group all CRL Lab Integration AccessionCode errors within 30-minute windows

2. **Severity Rationalization**
   - Current Sev1 percentage is high (>80% of alerts)
   - Consider downgrading some integration errors to Sev2
   - Implement automatic severity escalation for repeated issues

3. **Monitoring Gaps**
   - Add proactive monitoring for lab integration endpoints
   - Implement early warning metrics for potential integration issues
   - Add correlation between infrastructure health and integration failures
